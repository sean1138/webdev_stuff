
001.css is not a bad set of reset rules to start with.  I've added and removed things over time specifically to deal with cross-browser consistency and other issues that I've come across.

001.html is a bare-bones files to start with but there are still some things you can remove from it depending on your project's needs/specs.

testel.html is a great concept that I stole from http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www.html - all credits retained in the file, for testing whatever you want, putting just about every element on the page for testing.

The worstcase images are my own measurements made in browsers for viewport dimensions before responsive design became the hip new thing - strengthening the idea that you should have nothing break or be out of place in a 1000x600 viewport design space.

002.css is my attempt at a somewhat structured, flexible, and hopefully responsive friendly grid system.
